# Where In The World

## Description
This code was written for one of my assignments in university, where the focus was on data cleaning and validation. 
Once the data was cleaned and validated, we were then asked to present the data.
I settled on presenting the coordinates on a webpage that contained a map with pins at each coordinate location.

## Usage

Specify the input file containing coordinates and other details, then run WhereInTheWorld.java. This will create a formattedInput file which is then converted to a .geojson file. 
Then run index.html which will use the Leaflet template to display each specified pair of coordinates in a locally hosted webpage for viewing.
